- 👋 Hi, I’m @riscman
- 👀 I’m learning how to use Git to manage changes 
    to three machines with different OSes. Namely:
    RISC OS MacOS and Linux 
- 🌱 I’m currently testing the RISC OS python Toolbox
- 💞️ I’m  writing a web based user guide 
    to help with using Python on RISC OS,
    which still hasn't seen a lot of testing.
