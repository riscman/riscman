- 👋 Hi, I’m @riscman
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use Git
    to help me lauch a collaborative project 
    to explore Python using RISC OS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing a web based user guide 
    to help RISC OS user navigate the pitfalls of using Python
    THis is neccessary as the Python RISC OS is raw and largely 
    untested. A lot of things do not work as yet.
